    <p>Early lifeüëç
Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in S√£o Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in Santo Ant√≥nio, Funchal.[15][16] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and Jos√© Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[17] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of S√£o Vicente, Cape Verde.[18] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana C√°tia "Katia".[19] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[20] Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[21]

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[22] where his father was the kit man,[17] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of ¬£1,500.[23] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting youth football academy.[23] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.[24] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[24] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[25] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[26] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[27][28]</p>
